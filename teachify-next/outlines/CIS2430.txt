assignment grading
• Independent practice assignments and inclass quizzes are machinegraded
• Written homework will be graded by the instructional team
• Coding assignments are graded partly by machine via and autograder and partly through
scheduled interviewdemo appointments
– There are four weeks in the semester during which coding assignments will be graded
– You may submit exactly one assignment for grading to any grading period A repository
with multiple assignments in it will be given a grade of 0
– Assignments must be submitted by the due date in order to be graded
– A coding assignment may be submitted in the next grading period at no penalty however
that is not advised as it will be extremely difficult to complete all three coding assign
ments in that case
– Work to be graded must be committed and pushed to the required git repository by 1159 PM
on the Sunday prior to the grading period An automated script will download your sub
missions at 1201 AM on Monday
All coding assignment grading includes a 11 appointment over MSTeams Make sure you have time during
the week after the due date to schedule an appointment

Academic Consideration for Coursework
Regrades
You can ask for a regrade on coursework only if errors were made in the grading
of your work It is not a grading error if you simply got a lower grade than you
were expecting To request a regrade you must email a detailed explanation of
exactly what the grading error is to the course email address within 5 days of
receiving your grade Be specific about what you believe was graded incorrectly
Your submission will be completely regraded A regrade could result in your grade
being reduced
Coding
Assignments
This course has a flexible submission policy for coding assignments If you can
not meet the original submission deadline for a coding assignment you may sub
mit that work during the following grading period at no penalty You may use this
flexibility to redo an assignment if you wish However you may not submit two assign
ments in a single grading period Use this flexibility as a last resort If you use this
flexibility too early in the course you greatly limit your time to complete all three
coding assignments
Independent
Practice
If you cannot complete an independent practice assignment by the deadline you
can make a request via email for academic consideration to have a later due date
Your request must be made at least 18 hours prior to the submission deadline
and there must be clear evidence that you have been working on the independ
ent practice assignment Requests made without these two prerequisites will be
denied Your request must include an explanation of the reasons for the request
but does not need to include personal details
Written
Homework
If you cannot complete a written homework assignment by the deadline you can
make a request via email for academic consideration to have a later due date
Your request must be made at least 18 hours prior to the submission deadline
and your email request must include clear evidence that you have been work
ing towards completing the assignment Requests made without these two pre
requisites will be deniedYour request must include an explanation of the reasons
for the request but does not need to include personal details
InClass
Quizzes
Quizzes missed for reasons requiring academic consideration may be made up
on the Tuesday following the quiz Makeup quiz times will be posted on the course
website You must notify the course instructors by email of your absence at least
5 hours BEFORE the scheduled quiz in order to qualify to a makeup The makeup
quiz may be a different format than the inclass quiz
If you feel that you merit academic consideration beyond the builtin flexibility of this course you
must provide documentation and written explanation to the instructor In your request please
provide evidence that you have been working steadily on the course work to show that your request
is not made as a result of procrastination If you make multiple requests during the semester you
may be asked for additional documentation

computing requirements
You should have a laptop to bring to lectures and tutorials All coursework will be completed independ
ently using the Java programming language Third party libraries and frameworks require explicit
approval of the course instructor Keep reliable backup copies of all assignments as you may be
asked to resubmit work at any time
In particular we will use the following programming tools and languages all of which are pre
installed on the SCIOER etext
• Open JDK 17
• Gradle 8
• Gitlab via gitlabsocsuoguelphca
• Junit 5
You will be expected to demonstrate your knowledge without the use of an IDE An IDE hides much
of the process from beginners and prevents learning We recommend using an editor such as
Sublime or a less complex IDE such as VSCode
You must have access to a computing device and internet connection that allows you to share your
screen in online meetings while having a voice conversation While sharing your screen you will be
asked to run your java programs so the device you use must be capable of compiling and running
your java assignments You will not be required to share a video feed

academic integrity
• The UofG Academic Misconduct Policy in the Undergraduate Calendar
• The SOCS Academic Integrity Unit Login with your central login credentials
The University of Guelph is committed to upholding the highest standards of academic integrity
and it is the responsibility of all members of the University community faculty staff and students
to be aware of what constitutes academic misconduct and to do as much as possible to prevent
academic offences from occurring University of Guelph students have the responsibility of abiding
by the University’s policy on academic misconduct regardless of their location of study faculty staff
and students have the responsibility of supporting an environment that discourages misconduct
All students who take a SOCS course must pass the Academic Integrity Self Test
For educational purposes instructors impose conditions on assignments that may limit students’
permission to collaborate with others or to utilize external sources including but not limited to
software data images text etc This includes any interaction with a large language model such
as ChatGPT Any permitted utilization must be done with proper references Aiding and abetting
is a punishable offence students must be careful not to help others commit offences by giving
out solutions or providing to access computer accounts Instructors may use automated tools to
detect possible cases of academic misconduct
The use of an AILarge Language Model eg ChatGPT will be required for specific assignments
in this course When use of the tool is required it will be explicitly noted in the assignment instruc
tions Any use of an AI for this course that is not specifically identified in an assignment description
constitutes an academic integrity violation
Please note Whether or not a student intended to commit academic misconduct is not relevant for
a finding of guilt Hurried or careless submission of assignments does not excuse students from
responsibility for verifying the academic integrity of their work before submitting it Students who
are in any doubt as to whether an action on their part could be construed as an academic offence
should consult with a faculty member
tldr
1 do not share your assignment solution with anyone even if it is only an outline
2 do not use an AI to solve your assignments If you cannot explain your work in person you
are likely to get a zero on the assignment
3 do not pay a third party to do your assignments If you cannot explain your work in person
you are likely to get a zero on the assignment
4 if you use any sources other than the course textbook to help you with assignments cite
them
