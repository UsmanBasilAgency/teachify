land acknowledgment
The Dish With One Spoon Covenant speaks to our collective responsibility to steward and sustain the land and environment in which we live and work, so that all peoples, present and future,
may benefit from the sustenance it provides. As we continue to strive to strengthen our relationships with and continue to learn from our Indigenous neighbours, we recognize the partnerships
and knowledge that have guided the learning and research conducted in and for this class. We
acknowledge that the University of Guelph resides in the ancestral and treaty lands of several Indigenous peoples, including the Attawandaron people and the Mississaugas of the Credit, and we
recognize and honour our Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, and Métis neighbours. We acknowledge
that the work we do here occurs on their traditional lands so that we might work to build lasting
partnerships that respect, honour, and value the culture, traditions, and wisdom of those who have
lived here since time immemorial.

a graded reflection assignment. Failure to attend the study session will normally result in a grade
of zero for that session. Students may be absent from one scheduled session in the semester
without penalty provided the course instructor is notified. The absent student must still complete
the reflection assignment. This accommodation is intended to be used by the students who are ill
and who should be staying home to get well.

• moodle.socs.uoguelph.ca for course website
You must have access to a computing device and internet connection that allows you to share your
screen and do demos of your work while having a voice conversation via Slack.
A video feed is nice for online meetings but is not required. Screen sharing is required.

academic integrity
The University of Guelph is committed to upholding the highest standards of academic integrity
and it is the responsibility of all members of the University community faculty, staff, and students
to be aware of what constitutes academic misconduct and to do as much as possible to prevent
academic offences from occurring. University of Guelph students have the responsibility of abiding
by the University’s policy on academic misconduct regardless of their location of study; faculty, staff
and students have the responsibility of supporting an environment that discourages misconduct.
All students who take a SOCS course must pass the Academic Integrity Self Test.
For educational purposes, instructors impose conditions on assignments that may limit students’
permission to collaborate with others or to utilize external sources (including, but not limited to,
software, data, images, text, etc.). Any permitted utilization must be done with proper references.
Aiding and abetting is a punishable offence; students must be careful not to help others commit
offences by giving out solutions or providing to access computer accounts. Instructors may use
automated tools to detect possible cases of academic misconduct.
Please note: Whether or not a student intended to commit academic misconduct is not relevant for
a finding of guilt. Hurried or careless submission of assignments does not excuse students from
responsibility for verifying the academic integrity of their work before submitting it. Students who
are in any doubt as to whether an action on their part could be construed as an academic offence
should consult with a faculty member.
• The Academic Misconduct Policy is detailed in the Undergraduate Calendar here.
• The SOCS Academic Integrity Unit is here. Login with your central login credentials.

policies
• Regrades: If errors were made in the grading of your work, you must, in writing, present your
case to the instructor within 5 days of receiving your grade. Be specific about what you believe
was graded incorrectly. Your submission will be completely regraded. This could result in your
grade being reduced. It is not a grading error if you simply got a lower grade than you were
expecting.
• Missed or Late Assessments: If you are unable to meet an in-course requirement due to medical, psychological, or compassionate reasons, please contact the Instructor and explain the
situation. Include any evidence you have to support your case. If you merit academic consideration for one of the assessments, you will be given an alternate assessment.
Please consult the undergraduate calendar for information on regulations and procedures for
Academic Consideration.
• Communication & Email Policy Major announcements will be posted to the course website. It
is your responsibility to check the course website regularly. As per university regulations, all
students are required to check their mail.uoguelph.ca e-mail account regularly: e-mail is the
official route of communication between the University and its students.
• Recording of Materials Presentations which are made in relation to course work, including lectures, cannot be recorded or copied without the permission of the presenter, whether the
instructor, classmate, or guest lecturer. Material recorded with permission is restricted to
use for that course and may not be posted on any public space unless further permission is
granted.
• Accommodation of Religious Obligations: if you are unable to meet an in-course requirement due
to religious obligations, please email the instructor within two weeks of the start of the semester
to make alternate arrangements. See the academic calendar for information on regulations
and procedures for Academic Accommodation of Religious Obligations.
• Instructor's Role and Responsibility to Students The instructor’s role is to develop and deliver
course material in ways that facilitate learning for a variety of students. A variety of materials,
including notes and recorded lectures, will be made available on the course website.
• Students' Learning Responsibilities Students are expected to take advantage of the learning opportunities provided during lectures, labs, and help sessions. Students, especially those having difficulty with the course content, should also make use of other resources recommended
by the instructor. Students who fall behind due to illness, work, or extra-curricular activities
are advised inform the instructor about their situation as early as possible. This will allow the
instructor to recommend extra resources in a timely manner and/or provide consideration if
warranted.
• Accessibility The University of Guelph is committed to creating a barrier-free environment.
Providing services for students is a shared responsibility among students, faculty and administrators. This relationship is based on respect of individual rights, the dignity of the individual
and the University community’s shared commitment to an open and supportive learning environment. Students requiring service or accommodation, whether due to an identified, ongoing
disability, or for a short-term disability should contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) as
soon as possible.
For more information, contact SAS at 1.519.824.4120 ext 56208 or accessibility@uoguelph.ca
or wellness.uoguelph.ca/accessibility.

code of conduct
Our learning environment must be a safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of ethnicity,
gender, sexual orientation, ability, socioeconomic status, and/or religion (or lack thereof). This code
of conduct outlines the expectations for all participants 1 .
• Expected Behaviour: Members of our learning community are expected to:
– participate in an authentic and active way, and in doing so, contribute to the health and
value of our community,
– exercise consideration and respect in their speech and actions,
– attempt collaboration before conflict,
– refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech,
– be mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants, and alert community leaders (e.g. your instructor) if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or
violation of this Code of Conduct, even if it seems inconsequential.
• Citizenship & Participation: Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive
action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist
in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is
welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we
want to know.
• Unacceptable Behaviour: Unacceptable behaviours include: intimidating, harassing, abusive,
discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community, either in person, online, at any related events, or in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial
verbal or written comments related to race, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including computer labs and
presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or
recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and
unwelcome sexual attention.
• Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour: Unacceptable behaviour from any community member, including the course instructor and those members with decision-making authority, will
not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, action will be taken to
ensure that such behaviour ends, beginning with action on the part of the course instructor,
and escalating if necessary. Additional information on University policy regarding harassment, conduct, and human rights is available here.
• If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behaviour or Have Any Other Concerns: please notify
the course instructor as soon as possible. If you feel that the course instructor cannot or will
not provide remedy for the situation, please contact any of these alternate resources:
– Associate Director, Undergraduate (click here to email),
– Director of the School (click here to email),
– Associate Dean, Academic (click here to email),
– Office of Diversity and Human Rights (click here to email, or ext 53000),
– Campus Community Police (ext 52245).
